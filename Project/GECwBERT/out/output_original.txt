Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing
what is the genetic risk ?
genetic risk refers more to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
people get a certain disease because of genetic changes .
How much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear .
if your genetic results indicate that you may have gene changes associated with an increased risk heart disease , it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease .
The opposite is also true .
if your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible that you will develop heart disease .
however for some rare cases , people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease .
when we are agonised out with certain genetic disease , we are suppose to disclose this result to our relatives ?
My answer is no .
on one hand , we do not want this potential danger of causing frightening affects in families ' later lives .
When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .
And both are not what we want since most of us just want to live as normal people .
surrounded by other such concerns , it is very likely that we are distracted worry about these problems .
It is a concern that will be with us during our whole life , because we will never know when the ''potential bomb' ' will explode .
On the other hand , if there are ways can help us to control or cure the disease , we can going through thses process from the scope of the whole family .
for an example , if exercising is helpful for family potential for disease , we can always look for more chances for the family to go exercise .
And we keep track of all family members health conditions .
at the same time , we are prepared to know when the other members got this disease .
Here I want to share Forest'view on this issue .
although some people may feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington 's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings , there currently is no legal requirement to do so .
in fact , requiring someone to communicate about his or her own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious .
"
Nothing is absolute right or wrong .
If certain disease genetic test is very accurate and it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and known by others , it is OK to disclose the result .
Above all , life is more important than secret .
genetic risk can carry its consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle .
Afterall , what affects one family may or may not affect another although the families has a common genetic make up , shared by either of the parents .
In cases where an individual has gotten to know of a genetic disorder , disclosing or otherwise , to his or her relative is solely a matter of preference within the indivdial moral system .
The issue on right to know or not to know is highly debatable although it is a genetic risk , one can not be entire sure because the genetic information could possibly result from the families of either parents - his maternal and paternal uncles , aunts or cousin .
This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has a knowledge about others .
this knowledge is maybe relevant to them , and vice versa .
an example may serve as an illustration of breast cancer .
It is hereditary .
do one who suffered from this disease keep it a secret from infirm relatives ?
In retrospect , its is also ones duty to ensure that he or she undergo periodic healthchecks in their own .
sometimes some family structure and other cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication .
Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from : the son or daughter for example , the parents who knows about this would decide who gets told and whom takes the precedence in being 'allowed ' to tell .
For example , within a family , regardless of who had first received genetic information , parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring , either adult at risk .
In addition , a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself , although this may be further complicated by an individual 's response to risk information as they not want to know .
Hence , there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know ( such as nieces and nephews ) nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to do so .
The notion of authority also extended 'vertically' .
For example , a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt , even when she is not at genetic risk herself while the aunt is .
From a practitioner 's perspective these findings are important because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are a social construct they may not be in line with geneticists ' views of family relationships , or about which blood ( or non-blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context .
Ultimately , one must bring attention to who may benefit from such information and assisting those at risk to make considered decisions about disclosure .
Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
people with a close blood relationship generally carry some similar genes .
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry genetic risk , it is better for the patient to tell his/her close relatives about the issue and let others known about the risk so that his/her familay members are able to perform some daily excesses to prevent the potential disease or they may go to hospital and check for the correspongding flows .
in my opinion , although the nuance of the genetic risk involves the issue of self privacy , it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to tell the issue to his or her relatives in order for them to prevent the potential disease .
