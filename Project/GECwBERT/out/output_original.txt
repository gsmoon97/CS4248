Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing
what is the genetic risk ?
genetic risk refers more to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
people get a certain disease because of genetic changes .
How much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear .
if your genetic results indicate that you may have gene changes associated with an increased risk heart disease , it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease .
The opposite is also true .
if your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible that you will develop heart disease .
however for some rare cases , people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease .
when we are agonised out with certain genetic disease , we are suppose to disclose this result to our relatives ?
My answer is no .
on one hand , we do not want this potential danger of causing frightening affects in families ' later lives .
When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .
And both are not what we want since most of us just want to live as normal people .
surrounded by other such concerns , it is very likely that we are distracted worry about these problems .
It is a concern that will be with us during our whole life , because we will never know when the ''potential bomb' ' will explode .
On the other hand , if there are ways can help us to control or cure the disease , we can going through thses process from the scope of the whole family .
for an example , if exercising is helpful for family potential for disease , we can always look for more chances for the family to go exercise .
And we keep track of all family members health conditions .
at the same time , we are prepared to know when the other members got this disease .
